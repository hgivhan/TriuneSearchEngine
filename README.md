This application seeks to make information available to herbalists using the Triune Formulation Method (fondly and not-so-fondly referred to as: "Herbal Sudoku").

This application will allow users to search for herbs based on various filters to find the perfect fit for a particular formula.
Users will search herbs based on various attributes, such as dosage (parts), body system affected, and the desired effect on chosen body system (builder, neutral, eliminator). Additionally, users will be able to search a body system to see a listing of useful herbs as well as search a specific herb by name (common or latin) to see general information.
